#GAME

The strategy used in this game is the same as in the one presented at the lab classes, minefield.
In this game the user should avoid hidden bombs around the map. In order to win every spot on the map that
doesnt have a bomb should be revealed. The player is guided to the solution by strategically placed logic messages
that hold hints for the next moves. When the game finishes the user will be prompted with the result of the game as 
text message in the display area.


#LAYOUT

The map consists in a <size>x<size> square grid with a minimal display where the text of the messages
will be displayed. An empty cell is displayed as a white grid cell, a hidden one is colored in gray, the 
current position of the player is displayed using the green color and the bombs and the messages are represented
using specific sprites.


#MECHANICS

The gameplay consists in moving around the grid using the arrow keys. The directions of the movements are horizontal
and vertical.
